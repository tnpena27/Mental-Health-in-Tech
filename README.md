# Mental-Health-in-Tech
Senior capstone project analyzing the correlation of mental health care options and mental health discussions in the workplace.

#### Introduction
This project will seek to answer the following research question
> Is there a correlation between the availability of mental health resources and employeesâ€™ willingness to discuss mental health issues at work, and is there a difference in employee comfort levels in discussing mental health issues between those who know their mental health care options and those who do not?
